# Today's Guidelines

Construct a Portfolio site from the ground-up.
The design should be all yours, so that means no Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation frameworks to underpin your site.
As an example of what you might want to construct, wireframes have been provided (you may not want to do the slideshow right now, but go for it).

## Content

- Information about you that would be relevant to a potential employer
- Your name should appear somewhere on the page
- Your projects should be linked to the GitHub repos that host their code. If you wrote something for a code project, you should consider putting it on this portfolio page
- Your skills should be listed out in columns
- There should be a picture of your face somewhere on the page
- There should be a professionally-relevant bio of you and your journey into code
- There should be obvious links to your GitHub and LinkedIn profile pages. You can include other social links, but make sure that whatever you link to would be something you'd want an employer to see

## More Information

- Your Portfolio site should be fully functional, and designed with mobile-first principles in mind.
- Your CSS should be split up in the style of SMACSS.
- Your navigation menu should be different for mobile and desktop views
- If you use any third-party libraries (e.g. a slideshow javascript library, a CSS reset), they should be included in a `vendor` directory.
- Navigation links shouldn't go to new pages, but to different sections of the page.

If you have any questions, please ask.
Otherwise, go wild!
